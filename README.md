# Dependencies

The CMake build process will either find external dependencies on the
system if they have been properly installed, or automatically download and build
them from their official repositories in case they cannot be found. In that
regard, a proper installation of the dependencies is not required.

Said external dependencies are the following:

* [Google Logging (glog)](https://github.com/google/glog) (0.34 or later).
* [Google Test](https://github.com/google/googletest) (1.7.0 or later) __[Just for running the unit tests]__.
